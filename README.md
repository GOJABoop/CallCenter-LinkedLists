# CallCenter
Simple program that simulates a call center where there are employees and these employees have clients, where the objective is the use of linked lists and operations on them.

## Aims
The program aims to use the data structure: linked lists.


A simply linked list is used in addition to a circular doubly linked list, to store customers and employees respectively, 
in addition to an implementation of the QuickSort algorithm to sort the employee list.

## Notes
Notes
The program has been developed in c ++. As you can see, the project is a CodeBlocks file, so I recommend that you use this IDE to make it easier to run the project.

The software is compatible with any c ++ 11 compliant system.
